An early morning house fire killed a woman and a firefighter who was fatally injured as he searched the house, officials said Saturday.
Four other members of the woman's family were injured.
Fire Investigator Ray Mauck said the 4 a.m. fire started in the front room of the house in northwest Wichita but he would not comment on the cause.
"We are fairly sure at this time that it was an accidental fire," he said.
For students working in a miniature factory at the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is now.
Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging laboratory.
The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced such programs in the country.
An earthen dike broke early Sunday,forcing the evacuation of an estimated 1,500 people for several hours and closure of a major interstate highway, authorities said.
Police said the 2,500-foot-long dike, a section of the Quail Creek Dam on the Virgin River about 14 miles east of here, broke eight minutes after midnight.
The 50-foot-high dike released a wall of water 10 feet to 12 feet high, said Mike Brunn, a member of the Washington County Search and Rescue Team who watched the water gush through the river channel.
"If you had had a surfboard, you could have just rode the wave. It was that forceful," Brunn said.
