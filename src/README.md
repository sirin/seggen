seggen
======
Managing  genetic algorithm parameters to improve SegGen a thematic segmentation algorithm.
Our goal is to take into account the level of confidence that can be placed on the boundaries according to the progress of the algorithm.
The progress of the algorithm may be quantified by the rank of the current population either by an estimation its global quality.

Usage tips:
1) in /src/utilities/utility.py,  "/Users/sirinsaygili/workspace/seggen/src/stopwords.txt" path will be changed
for example: your project path is "/your-project-path/seggen/src/stopwords.txt"
2) in /src/utilities/utility.py,  "/Users/sirinsaygili/workspace/seggen/src/N1.txt" path will be changed
for example: your project path is "/your-project-path/seggen/src/N1.txt"
3) to run, open terminal and go to "/your-project-path/seggen/src/" and type "python seggen.py"
